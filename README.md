# Customer onboarding instructions - MQTT Broker Private Preview

The Microsoft Azure messaging team invites you and your organization to preview the MQTT Broker feature.  During this preview, we will provide full support with a high level of engagement from the Azure messaging product group. We look forward to your feedback  as you leverage this capability for your pub/sub solutions. Please note that this preview is available by invitation only  and requires an NDA. By participating in the private preview, you agree to the [Terms of Use](https://www.microsoft.com/legal/terms-of-use).

## Overview of MQTT Broker
MQTT broker is a pub/sub messaging broker, to enable secure transfer of messages to and from clients. You can now use MQTT’s flexible topic structure to send and receive messages from your clients (clients/services) and support flexible messaging patterns such as command and control and as well as broadcast messages to clients (clients/services).

## Private preview program information
The private preview is only for testing.  Please do NOT use it for your production.

**Engagement:**  We will actively engage with you during the preview. At any point, feel free to connect with us for questions/concerns by creating issues in the Samples repo, confidential questions can be asked to mqttbroker@microsoft.com.

**Feedback:**  At the end of the preview, we will capture additional feedback using this form.

**Cost to use:**  For this release, MQTT Broker is available for no additional charge. You will be charged for routing MQTT messages through Event Grid subscriptions (https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/event-grid/).

## Post private preview program
When the private preview program ends, or when your tests are complete, we will provision to migrate all the MQTT brokers and corresponding data to public preview.

However, if you prefer to cleanup the private preview configuration, you can follow these below steps.

## Prerequisites
- We will enable the feature for the subscription ID you shared in the sign up form. If you haven't responded, please fill out this form
- To create an MQTT broker, use the ARM template/ use these APIs
	- Canary is the only region where MQTT Broker is currently supported
	- You can use one of the two ARM templates available. 
		- ARM template without routing
		- ARM template with routing
- 3.	Clone the repo
	- For all the scenarios below we have provided sample code in Python using the Paho MQTT client.
	- Current samples for private preview will use existing MQTT libraries and include helper functions that can be used in your own applications.  To connect to the new MQTT broker, the clients must use authentication based on X.509 certificates.  Once the client is connected regular pub/sub operations will work.
- Use portal or ARM client or CLI to create resourcing using ARM templates, GitHub deploy to Azure – click here to get to the ARM template
- CLI – generic ARM template commands;
- Install Azure ARM client to perform HTTP requests against broker management service to create/read/update/delete child resources.  Or, use a different tool that allows you to perform HTTP requests and use client certificates.
- To route your messages from your clients to different Azure services or your custom endpoint, an Event Grid topic needs to be created and referenced during namespace creation to forward the messages to that topic for routing; this reference cannot be added/updated afterwards. That can be achieved by one of two ways:
	- Use the X ARM template to create the namespace and the Event Grid topic where the messages will be forwarded.
	- Create an Event Grid topic in the same region as the same namespace and configured to use “Cloud Event Schema v1.0”, then input the topic’s ARM ID as the “routeTopic” during namespace creation.
- If client uses X509, self-signed do this
- Should we provide a way to create X.509 certificates? – customers will bring their own certs
- Support MQTTX Explorer? – add tutorial to use for a simple scenario? P1
- Use your favorite mqtt tool to test

### Warning
- MQTT broker is in early development and this tech preview is available in the spirit of transparency. Bugs are expected, and we look forward to feedback via email to mqttbroker@microsoft.com.
- Before deviating from the steps in this QuickStart, be sure to review the limitations listed below for the corresponding feature to avoid any confusion.

## QuickStart
Let us get started with a \"hello world\" scenario, with a publisher and subscriber communicating on a topic. Below table enumerates all the resources used in this example.

|Client name|Client Group|PermissionBinding|TopicSpace|Topic template|
| ------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ |
|Pub_client|Pub_Client_Group|Publisher|sample/topic|sample/#|
|Sub_client|Sub_Client_Group|Subscriber|sample/topic|sample/#|

Ensure you have the MQTT broker is enabled for the subscription you provided. (--- how? ---)
Control plane setup – subscription, namespace details, etc.
For quick start, please download all the files in this folder (--- to be added ---).
This folder contains all the necessary artifacts required to run the quick start including a dummy certificate and a .exe file that you can run (--- how/where? ---) to create all the necessary resources.
Also, code is made available to customize as per your testing needs. However, before deviating from the steps in this QuickStart, be sure to review the limitations listed below for the corresponding feature to avoid any confusion.
 – script
Then the new .exe for hello world
Need to create a client to run management plane commands, etc.  
For quick start, out of the box, client gets instantiated and runs.


## Scenarios
Here are a few scenarios you can try out.  Please refer the details below about the limitations.

| # | Scenario | Description |
| ------------ | ------------ | ------------ |
| 1 | Fan-out (one-to-many) messages  | This scenario simulates cloud-to-client commands to several clients and can be leveraged for use cases such as sending alerts to clients. Consider the use case where a fleet management service needs to send a weather alert to all the vehicles in the fleet. For instructions see README.  |
| 2 | Fan-in (many to one) messaging  | This scenario simulates publishing messages from multiple clients to a single client.  Consider a use case where one needs to identify location of vehicles on a map.  For instructions see README. |
| 3 | One to one messaging  | This scenario simulates publishing messages from one client to another.  Consider a use case where a user can unlock their car from a mobile app.  For instructions see README.  |
| 4 | Route MQTT data through Event Grid subscription  | This scenario showcases how to configure route to send filtered messages from broker to the endpoint: Kafka on Event Hub through EG subscription.  Consider a use case where one needs to identify location of vehicles.  For instructions see README.  |

### Other scenarios to consider
- Test the throttle limits
- Test the naming considerations


## Terminology
Some of the key terms relevant for private preview are explained below.

| Term| Definition |
| ------------ | ------------ |
| MQTT Broker| An MQTT broker is an intermediary entity that enables MQTT clients to communicate. Specifically, an MQTT broker receives messages published by clients, filters the messages by topic, and distributes them to subscribers. |
| Namespace| A namespace is a declarative region that provides a scope to the resources (certificates, clients, client groups, topicspaces, permissionbindings, etc.) inside it.  Namespaces are used to organize the resources into logical groups. |
| Client| Client can be a client or a service that will connect to the MQTT broker and publish and/or subscribe to MQTT messages |
| Certificate / Cert| Certificate is a form of asymmetric credential. They are a combination of a public key from an asymmetric keypair and a set of metadata describing the valid uses of the keypair.  If the keypair of the issuer is the same keypair as the certificate, the certificate is said to be “self-signed”. Third-party certificate issuers are sometimes called Certificate Authorities (CA). |
| Client attributes| Client attributes represent a set of key-value pairs that provide descriptive information about the client.  For example, Floor 3 is an attribute that provides the client's location. |
| Client group| Client group is a collection of clients that are segregated by a set of common client attribute(s) using a query string, and will publish and/or subscribe to a specific TopicSpace |
| Topic space | Topic space is a new concept introduced to simplify management of topics used for pub/sub.  A topic space is a set of topics within the broker.  Topic space is defined using MQTT topic templates and filters with support for MQTT wildcards and variable substitutions. It can be used to limit the set of topics based on the properties of the MQTT client. |
| Topic filter| An MQTT topic filter is an MQTT topic, possibly with wildcards for one or more segments allowing it to match multiple MQTT topics.  Supported wildcards are +, which matches a single segment and #, which matches zero or more segments at the end of the topic.  See Topic Wildcards from the MQTT specification for more details. |
| Topic template| Topic templates are an extension of the topic filter that includes support for variables. This simplifies management for high scale applications.  A topic space can consist of multiple topic templates.  For example, vehicles/\${principal.clientid}/GPS/#.  Here, ${principal.clientid} part is the variable that substitutes into the client Id during an MQTT session. |
| Variable| A value in a topic template that will be filled in based on the properties of the authenticated client.  A variable can represent a portion of a segment or an entire segment but cannot cover more than one segment.  For example, if we want the client to publish on its own topic, you can use the topic vehicles/${principal.clientId}/GPS/location.  For this topic template, vehicle1 can only publish to vehicles/vehicle1/GPS/location.  If vehicle1 attempts to publish on topic vehicles/vehicle2/GPS/location, it will fail. | 
| Topic space type| The type of the topic space.  Must be one of HighFanout, LowFanout or PublishOnly . The high fanout and low fanout types are needed to adjust for the expected number of clients receiving each message, while the publish only option makes a topic space useable only for publishing. |
| Fanout| The number of clients that will receive a given message. A low fanout message would be received by only a small number of clients. See throttle limits |
| PermissionBinding| Associates a client group with a specific TopicSpace as a publisher and/or subscriber  |

## Concepts

### Client Authentication
In the context of an identity-based access control system, authentication is the process of verifying an identity. Authentication occurs by the client proving to the server that it possesses the secret data/credential, which links to it’s identity via a trusted channel.  To authenticate the identity, the client proves possession of the credential, and through the transitive property, its identity.
In MQTT systems using an identity-based access control model, authentication generally happens once during session establishment.  Then, all future operations using the same session are assumed to come from that identity.
The following credential types are currently supported:
- Certificates issued by a Certificate Authority (CA) – asymmetric
- Self-signed certificates - asymmetric

**Certificates:** Certificates, are a form of asymmetric credential.  They are a combination of a public key from an asymmetric keypair and a set of metadata describing the valid uses of the keypair. 
For asymmetric keypair based authentication, the identity registry must store the identity’s public key alongside the identity record so that it can verify tokens sent by the client and signed with the private key.

**CA signed certificates:**  For trusted issuer certificates (CA signed), the identity registry only needs to store the list of trusted issuers and the public keys that these issuers use to sign certificates.  The link between credential and identity is not stored in the identity registry but is embedded in the certificate itself.  Because the metadata can be trusted by verifying the certificate issuer, the identity registry can trust the identity listed in the subject field and does not need to store any additional information about the credentials.
In this method, a root or intermediate X.509 certificate is registered with the service.  Later, clients can authenticate if they have a valid leaf certificate that's derived from the root or intermediate certificate.

**Self-signed certificates:**  For self-signed certificates, the identity registry must store either the identity certificate’s public key or the identity’s certificate thumbprint alongside the identity record.  The certificate thumbprint is a cryptographic hash of the certificate data (public key and metadata).  The identity registry needs to store the exact ID of the certificate that the client is going to use to authenticate. 

### Topic Spaces
Topic space is a new concept introduced to simplify management of topics used for publishing and subscribing by your clients.

**Topic space:**  A topic space is a set of topic templates (defined below). It is used to simplify access control management by enabling you to grant publish or subscribe access to a group of topics at once instead of individual topics.  
It is important to note that the publishing is a supported action on all topic spaces by default; however, you need to configure the subscription support as detailed below.

**Topic filter:**  An [MQTT topic filter](http://docs.oasis-open.org/mqtt/mqtt/v3.1.1/os/mqtt-v3.1.1-os.html#_Toc398718106) is an MQTT topic that can include wildcards for one or more of its segments, allowing it to match multiple MQTT topics. It is used to simplify subscriptions declarations as one topic filter can match multiple topics.

The service supports all the MQTT wildcards defined by the [MQTT specification](https://docs.oasis-open.org/mqtt/mqtt/v3.1.1/os/mqtt-v3.1.1-os.html#_Toc398718107) as follows:
- +: which matches a single segment.
	- E.g. topic filter: “machines/+/alert” will match the following topics:
		- machines/temp/alert
		- vehicles/humidity/alert
- #: which matches zero or more segments at the end of the topic. 
	- E.g. topic filter: “machines/#” will match the following topics:
		- machines
		- machines/temp
		- machines/humidity
		- machines/temp/alert etc

See [Topic Wilcards](https://docs.oasis-open.org/mqtt/mqtt/v3.1.1/os/mqtt-v3.1.1-os.html#_Toc398718107) from the MQTT spec for more details.

**Topic template:** Topic templates are an extension of the topic filter that supports variables. It is used for fine-grained access control within a client group. You can provide access to a client group to publish or subscribe on a topic space with multiple topic templates. If any of the topic templates include a variable, only the clients associated with this variable will have access to the corresponding topic.

For example, you can provide access to client group “machines” to the topic space “machinesTelemetry” that includes the topic template “machines/${client.name}/temp”. Only the machine with client name = machine1 will be able to publish on topic “machines/machine1/temp”, and only the machine with client name = machine2 will be able to publish on topic “machines/machine2/temp”, and so on. This prevents machine2 from publishing false information on behalf of machine1, even though it has access to the same topic space, and vice versa. 

**Supported variables:**
- ${client_name}: this variable represents the name of the client assigned during client creation.
- ${client.attributes.x}: this variable represents any of the assigned attributes to a client during client creation/update, so as “x” would be equal to the exact string of the attribute key. Read more about client attributes in the Terminology section.

**Note:** A variable can represent a portion of a segment or an entire segment but cannot cover more than one segment. E.g. a topic template could include “machines/${client.name|.factory1}/temp” will match topics “machines/machine1.factory1/temp”, “machines/machine2.factory1/temp”, etc

**Subscription support:** Subscription support is used to optimize the service’s mode of  message delivery to your clients based on your scenario. There are three modes: 
- Not supported: will indicate that topic space could be used only for publishing. This will be helpful in scenarios when you expect your corresponding topic templates to overlap since this is the only mode that will allow your topic templates to overlap with any other topic template.
- Low fanout: will specify a subscription delivery mode optimized for having a maximum of 10 subscribers per topic, with very low latency. 
	- Example scenario: There is a group of vehicles with each vehicle subscribing to its own command delivered to its own topic.
- High fanout: will specify a subscription delivery mode optimized for having unlimited number of subscribers per topic, with higher latency.
	- Example scenario: There is a large group of vehicles in a city subscribing to the same weather alerts that get broadcasted on the same topic.

### Topic space considerations
- **Default Behavior:**
To publish or subscribe to any topic, a matching topic space must be configured, and a permission binding needs to be set for the client group(s) that include the clients that need publish/subscribe access to this topic space. 
- **Topic templates Overlap:**
If you set your topic space with a low fanout or high fanout subscription modes, the corresponding topic templates cannot overlap with each other, but they can overlap with a topic space with “not supported” subscription support. The overlap exists if a topic could match more than one topic template: 
	- Examples:
		- “machines/${client.name}/temp” and “machines/+/temp” /#” overlap because the second template covers the first one via wildcard. 
		- vehicles/vehicle1/telemetry/# and vehicles/${principal.deviceId}/telemetry/# conflict because in the second template the segment with variable is treated as single level wildcard + and hence, covers the first topic template. PublishOnly topic spaces can overlap with LowFanout topic spaces.
- **Configuration:**
	- Topic templates use special characters $ and | and these need to be escaped differently based on the shell being used. In PowerShell, $ can be escaped with vehicles/${dollar}telemetry/#. If you’re using PowerShell, you can accomplish this as shown in the examples below: 
		- '"vehicles/${principal.deviceId|dollar}/#"'
		- 'vehicles/${principal.deviceId"|"dollar}/#'
	- Subscription support is immutable. To reconfigure the subscription support, delete the topic space and create a new topic space with the desired subscription support.
	- Topic space updates may take up to 5 minutes to propagate.

### Routing
This functionality will enable you to route your messages from your clients to different Azure services like Event hubs, Service Bus, etc or your custom endpoint. This functionality is achieved through [Event Grid](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/event-grid/), by sending all your messages from your clients to an [Event Grid topic](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/event-grid/custom-topics), and using [Event Grid subscriptions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/event-grid/subscribe-through-portal) to route the messages from that Event Grid topic to the [supported endpoints](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/event-grid/event-handlers).

Event Grid is a highly scalable, serverless event broker that you can use to integrate applications using events. Events are delivered by Event Grid to subscriber destinations such as applications, Azure services, or any endpoint to which Event Grid has network access. [Learn more](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/event-grid/)

**Note:**  To be able to take advantage of this feature, you have to either use the ARM template to create the Event Grid custom topic first and provide that topic’s ARM Id during the namespace creation.

### High-Level Steps
You can either use the X ARM template to create the Event Grid custom topic as well as the namespace or create your Event Grid custom topic as the first step to route your messages.

**Using the ARM template:**
1. Use the ARM template to create the [Event Grid topic](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/event-grid/custom-topics) as well as the namespace. The created custom topic is where all MQTT Broker messages will be forwarded.
2. Create an [Event Grid subscription](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/event-grid/subscribe-through-portal) to route these messages to one of the supported Azure services or a custom endpoint.

**Create your Event Grid custom topic:**
1. [Create an Event Grid custom topic](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/event-grid/custom-event-quickstart-portal) where all MQTT Broker messages will be forwarded. This topic needs to fulfill the requirements detailed below in the routing considerations.
2. Create an [Event Grid subscription](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/event-grid/subscribe-through-portal) to route these messages to one of the supported Azure services or a custom endpoint.
3. Create the namespace with MQTT Enabled and pass on the ARM ID for the custom topic that you created in step 1.

### Routing Considerations:
- The Event grid topic that will be used for routing need to fulfil the following requirements:
- It needs to be set to use the Cloud Event Schema v1.0
- It needs to be in the same region as the namespace
- **Filtering:**
	- You can use the Event Grid Subscription’s filtering capability to filter the routed messages based on the MQTT topic through filtering on the “subject” property in the Cloud Event schema. Event Grid Subscriptions supports free simple subject filtering by specifying a starting or ending value for the subject. For example, 
		- You can specify the subject ends with “gps” to only route messages reporting on location. 
		- You can filter the subject begins with “factory1/Area2/” to route only the messages that belong to facotry1 and area 2 to a specific endpoint and you can replicate this configuration to route messages from other factories/areas to different endpoints.
	- You can also take advantage of the [Event Subscription’s advanced filtering](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/event-grid/event-filtering#advanced-filtering) to filter based on the MQTT topic through filtering on the subject property in the Cloud Event Schema. This enable you to set more complex filters by secifying a comparison operator, key, and value. See the example below.

#### The schema for the Cloud Event Schema:
Each message being routed is enveloped in a Cloud Event according to the following schema sample: 
```json
{
    "specversion": "1.0",
    "id": "9aeb0fdf-c01e-0131-0922-9eb54906e20", // Unique id generated by the gateway upon receiving the message
    "time" : "2019-11-18T15:13:39.4589254Z", // time of message arriving to Azure pub-sub assigned by gateway
    "type" : "MQTT.EventPublished",
    "source"  : "namespace1", // name of your namespace that received the MQTT message.
    "subject" : "vehicles/ floor1/ vehicleId1/temp" , //MQTT topic that accompanied the MQTT publish message.   
  "data" : “<Published MQTT message>”
}
```
